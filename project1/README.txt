Utilised different api's by registering with api partners to cretae dynamic data flow web paeges using html, css, hs, php, and other libraries. I chose this map as it was an option 
that was suggested on stackoverflow with guides on how to manipulate the map data. Youtube and api docs provided me necessary reference to work with.
